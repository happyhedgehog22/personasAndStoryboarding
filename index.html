							<h2>What is the CVS self checkout machine?</h2>
							<p>The CVS Self Checkout machine has several components</p>
							<p>
								1. The main screen that the customer interacts with. It shows items scanned on the left and instructions and buttons on the right. Gives the user the option to look up their extra care number, switch to Spanish, use their own bag, call for help, or finish and pay. <br>
								2. This area holds the bags that the customer can use <br>
								3. This is the barcode scanner where users can scan their items <br>
								4. This is the bagging area where customers can place their items once scanned <br>
								5. This is the payment device where users can insert their card to pay
							</p>
							<p>The CVS Self Checkout machine allows customers to check out without a cashier. This is beneficial for both the customers and employees because the customers won't have to wait in as long of lines and the employees can spend their time elsewhere if needed.</p>

							<h2>Observations and Interviews</h2>
							
							<p>Observations 
								<ul>
									<li>On average the customers using the self check out machine seemed to finish checking out slightly faster than those who checked out with the cashier</li>
									<li>Approximately 15-20% of the people observed needed assistance from the cashier</li>
									<li>2-3 of the people observed tried to select no cash back on the card reader using their hand instead of the pen and were unable to</li>
									<li>All customers seemed to click the buttons on the screen almost immediately as they moved from one step to the next</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>Interview Questions 
								<ol>
									<li>Why did you choose self checkout over checking out with the cashier</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Two interviewees chose self checkout so that they would not have to interact with anyone. One interviewee chose self checkout because it had a shorter line than cashier checkout.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>How long did you expect to spend in self checkout?</li>
										<ul>
											<li>All interviewees expected to spend between 1 and 5 minutes in self checkout depending on the number of items they had.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>How long did you actually spend in self checkout?</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Two interviewees spent around the amount of time they expected in self checkout. One spent an additional 3 minutes because she didn't place the items in the bagging area fast enough and the cashier had to come over and help.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>On a scale of 1-10 how easy would you say self checkout was with one being the easiest and 10 being the hardest</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Two interviewees rated it a 1 and one (the one who didn't place her items in the bagging area fast enough) rated it a 4</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Did you encounter any difficulties while using the machine</li>
										<ul>
											<li>One didn't place her items in the bagging area fast enough, another tried to use their hand instead of the pen to select no cash back and the third faced no difficulties</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Would you choose self checkout over cashier checkout again?</li>
										<ul>
											<li>All three interviewees said yes</li>
										</ul>

							<h2>Personas</h2>
							<h3>Antisocial Allison</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Antisocial Allison chose self check out because she wanted to avoid human interaction. She was embarrassed by her purchases and didn’t want to face any judgement from the cashier.</li>
									<li>She noticed that paper towels were buy one get one 50% off so she decided to pick up two packs. When she scanned her items she didn’t see the discount applied. She really wanted her discount, so she had to request help and interact with the cashier. Her problem with the interface was that it didn’t tell her that she had to input her phone number for her extra care card before clicking finish and pay.</li>
									<li>This persona is representative of a large number of self checkout users at the CVS on Thayer. Over half of the users I interviewed expressed that they wanted to use self check out because they didn’t want to have to interact with the cashier or any other people. This persona exemplifies the desire to not speak with anyone during their checkout process.</li>
								</ul>

							<h3>Expert Ethan</h3>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li>Expert Ethan always chooses self checkout because he knows how to use it. </li>
									<li>He is able to use the machine with little to no issue. He places his items in the bagging area immediately after scanning them, enters his extra care card and clicks finish and pay. </li>
									<li>This persona is representative of a large number of self checkout users at the cvs on Thayer street. This CVS is frequented by people who go often and almost always use the self checkout. They know how to use the machine quickly and therefore choose this option.</li>
